This is an image gallery website **built without frameworks**, showcasing a stream of images in an adaptive multi-column layout.

## Important Notes

1. While the images showcased may seem unusual to some, I hope you can appreciate the technical aspects of the project.

2. The intention is to ultimately credit original artists for the images presented on the site. If you are an artist and want me to remove your image, please contact me.
